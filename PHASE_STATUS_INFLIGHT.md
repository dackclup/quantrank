# PHASE_STATUS_INFLIGHT.md — append-only side-file for in-flight PRs

This file exists to solve the **parallel-PR §Phase status collision
pattern** documented in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) §Gotchas. Every PR
that needs to satisfy the §Conventions "ship with every PR" lockstep
rule was previously inserting a `**X in flight (this PR)**` bullet
at the same anchor line in CLAUDE.md §Phase status + AGENTS.md
§Phase + version state. Two PRs opened in parallel both target that
single line → `mergeable_state: dirty` → recurring `git merge`
conflicts → user frustration.

Surfaced 2026-05-24 by PR #230 (`docs(form4)+ci(simulate)`) which
hit the collision pattern **3 times in one session** while iterating
on the simulate-cap fix:
- vs PR #229 (security WARN cleanup) mid-iteration
- vs PR #232 + PR #233 (LedgerCraft A1 + A2) before Mark-Ready
- vs PR #234 + PR #235 + PR #236 (LedgerCraft A3 + B1 + B2+B3+B4)
  during the simulate-fix re-push loop

Each conflict was BENIGN (both PRs added distinct entries at the
same insertion line; resolution was always "keep both in
chronological order"). But `git merge` cannot auto-detect that.

## The new convention

**Open PRs MUST add their in-flight entry HERE**, not directly to
CLAUDE.md §Phase status or AGENTS.md §Phase + version state. New
entries go at the END of this file (append-only). Parallel PRs both
append to disjoint last-lines and `git merge` resolves trivially —
no conflict.

**Format** — one fenced block per in-flight PR, dated header,
trailing horizontal rule for visual separation:

```
## PR #NNN — <one-line summary> (in flight, 2026-MM-DD)

<2-15 line paragraph describing the change, the rationale, and any
follow-up items. Mirrors the format used by historical entries in
CLAUDE.md §Phase status — keep it readable for the next reviewer.>

---
```

**On merge** — the entry STAYS HERE (do NOT move on merge). This
file is append-only by design; the cost of in-place moves at merge
time would re-introduce the collision pattern. The historical
record gets aggregated periodically (weekly / per-release) by a
**housekeeping commit** that:

1. Moves entries from this file's "Merged" section (auto-marked by
   the housekeeping script — see `tools/housekeep_phase_status.py`
   when implemented) into CLAUDE.md §Phase status with their
   `merged via PR #N (commit-SHA)` headers
2. Leaves the still-in-flight section untouched

The housekeeping commit is one-touch (single file modified, all PR
authors disjoint by then) so it doesn't re-trigger the parallel-PR
collision.

## File structure

```
# PHASE_STATUS_INFLIGHT.md
## In flight (current)
  ## PR #NNN — ... (in flight, YYYY-MM-DD)
  ## PR #MMM — ... (in flight, YYYY-MM-DD)
## Merged (awaiting housekeeping move to CLAUDE.md)
  ## PR #LLL — ... (merged YYYY-MM-DD, SHA)
```

After housekeeping runs, the "Merged" sub-section drains to empty
(entries land in CLAUDE.md §Phase status proper); "In flight"
keeps growing/draining as PRs cycle.

## Cross-references

- [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) §Conventions — the lockstep rule that
  this file satisfies
- [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) §Gotchas "Parallel-PR §Phase status
  collision pattern" — the recurring symptom this file fixes
- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) §Phase + version state — cross-tool
  mirror of CLAUDE.md §Phase status; same housekeeping pattern
  applies

## SKIP this file when

- The PR is a doc-only edit to this file itself (the lockstep is
  trivially satisfied)
- The PR is updating CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md ONLY (no code change) —
  in that case, edit CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md directly; the parallel
  collision risk is low for doc-only PRs since they're less common
- Housekeeping commits that move entries from here to CLAUDE.md —
  those touch CLAUDE.md + this file but the rationale is in the
  commit message, not a duplicated in-flight entry

## In flight (current)

_All entries below the convention header were drained 2026-06-03 in the Claude
token-economy PR (they had grown to ~5,680 lines / ~95K tok, almost entirely
merged PRs whose labels were never updated from "(in flight, this PR)"). The
merged narrative is preserved in git history + summarized in PHASE_STATUS.md.
This file restarts lean per its own "Merged -> housekeeping move" convention._

## PR #391 — Claude token-economy optimization (in flight, 2026-06-03)

**Branch**: `claude/dreamy-heisenberg-4IfRj`
**Type**: chore(infra) — docs + agent infrastructure only; no compute / schema /
scoring / valuation / frontend / dependency change; no schema bump.

**Goal**: cut Claude token usage with zero capability loss.

- **P0** — drained CLAUDE.md §Gotchas detail -> `docs/GOTCHAS.md` (kept a 53-line
  index) + §Phase status merged-PR log -> `PHASE_STATUS.md` /
  `docs/PHASE_STATUS_ARCHIVE.md`. CLAUDE.md 3232->~560 lines, ~55.8K->~9.7K tok
  (-82%; ~46K saved per session AND per sub-agent spawn — sub-agents inherit
  project context).
- **P1** — collapsed AGENTS.md §"Phase + version state" ~1,068-line mirror ->
  pointer; reset this file to its header.
- **P2** — shortened `delegate-first.sh` injection (~220->~83 tok/turn) +
  `effort: max->high` on deterministic script-runners (`schema-sentinel`,
  `vercel-preview-auditor`).
- **New skill** `.claude/skills/thai-token-economy/SKILL.md` — Thai I/O <-> English
  internals discipline (honest: Thai is ~2-4x/char at the tokenizer, so keep
  reasoning/code/logs/commits in English, reply in concise Thai).
- New CLAUDE.md §Conventions bullet "CLAUDE.md is an INDEX" guards re-bloat.

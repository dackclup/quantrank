# QuantRank — Phase Status

| # | Phase | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Scaffolding + first deploy | ✅ DONE — 2026-05-07 |
| 1 | Universe + prices ingestion | ✅ DONE — 2026-05-08 |
| 2 | Fundamentals via SEC EDGAR | ✅ DONE — 2026-05-08 |
| 3 | Classical features + composite → **v1.0** | 🟡 in progress |
| 4 | Sentiment & alternative data | ⚪ not started |
| 5 | ML meta-learner + SHAP | ⚪ not started |
| 6 | Regime detection + validation → **v1.5** | ⚪ not started |
| 7 | Universe expansion (S&P 1500) | ⚪ not started |

**Current focus**: Phase 3 — Classical features → v1.0 milestone (in progress)

**Phase 3 sub-PR plan** (5 sub-PRs, mobile-friendly slicing):
- 🟡 **3a — Pillar feature modules** (current PR): all 30+ classical metrics
  in `compute/features/{quality,value,growth,health,profitability,risk,technical}.py`,
  extended `momentum.py`, extended `fundamentals.py` (more EDGAR concepts +
  annual history), SPY benchmark, golden-value tests.
- ⚪ 3b — Normalization, pillar aggregation, composite, risk overlay.
- ⚪ 3c — Fair price ensemble + price history (separate `stocks/history/{TICKER}.json`).
- ⚪ 3d — Charts (Pillar Radar + Fair Price Bar + Price History) + about page.
- ⚪ 3e — README polish + tag **v1.0**.

**Next deliverable**: 30+ classical metrics per pillar, normalized
sector-relative, 8 pillar scores combining into a real composite, plus the
ensemble fair price (DCF + Graham + RIM + multiples) and risk overlay
vetoes. Tag **v1.0** at the end of Phase 3.

**Phase 3 composite weights (10 pillars, sum = 1.00)**:

| Pillar | Weight | Status |
|---|---|---|
| quality | 0.22 | active |
| value | 0.18 | active |
| growth | 0.10 | active |
| momentum | 0.10 | active |
| health | 0.08 | active |
| profitability | 0.05 | active (NEW key) |
| technical | 0.04 | active (NEW key) |
| risk | 0.03 | active |
| sentiment | 0.10 | placeholder, redistributed in Phase 4 |
| ml | 0.10 | placeholder, redistributed in Phase 5 |

For Phase 3, sentiment + ml stay null; their 0.20 weight is redistributed
pro-rata across the active pillars (effective weights divided by 0.80).

**Verified production (Phase 2, 2026-05-08)**: https://quantrank.vercel.app
— 501 S&P 500 stocks ranked, schema `0.3.0-phase2`, real SEC EDGAR
fundamentals on every detail page.

## Phase 2 verified production stats
- Universe size: **501 stocks** (502 minus FI — see limitations below)
- Schema: `0.3.0-phase2`
- Compute time: **22m 1s** (well under 60 min cold target)
- Fundamentals coverage: **99.8%** (501 / 502)
- First production data live at https://quantrank.vercel.app/

## Phase 2 acceptance checklist — ✅ all met (2026-05-08)

- [x] All ~502 tickers have fundamental data attempts (≥80% with revenue + net_income) — 99.8% coverage
- [x] `filed_date` populated for every fundamental row in cache parquet
- [x] Golden-value `@network` tests pass for AAPL/MSFT/GOOGL/JPM/XOM
- [x] Stock detail pages render at `/stock/AAPL`, `/stock/MSFT`, etc.
- [x] `FISV` → `FI` normalization working (verified: `/stock/FISV/` → 404)
- [x] Cross-sectional null rate <5% on revenue, net_income, total_assets
- [x] Compute time <30 min cache hit / <60 min cold (22m 1s actual cold)
- [x] Schema bumped to `0.3.0-phase2` in metadata.json
- [x] CI green on the Phase 2 PR before merge

## Phase 2 known limitations
- **FI (Fiserv) excluded from rankings** due to insufficient yfinance price
  history (renamed from FISV in 2024 → only ~18 months of bars under the new
  ticker, and `momentum_12_1` needs ≥12 months). The override logic correctly
  drops FISV; FI just can't be scored yet. Will resolve naturally as data
  accumulates, or a hybrid FISV→FI history splice can be added in Phase 3+.
- **Other tickers with corporate actions in the last 12 months may hit the
  same issue.** Consider adding an orchestrator log line in Phase 3:
  `"X tickers excluded due to insufficient history: %s"` for visibility in
  GitHub Actions logs.

## Resolved housekeeping
- ✅ `EDGAR_USER_AGENT` secret added to GitHub Actions secrets (Phase 2 setup)
- ✅ `FISV` → `FI` ticker rename — fixed in Phase 2 PR #4 (`TICKER_OVERRIDES`
  in `compute/ingest/universe.py`)
